# seqtools

## Installation

seqtools is currently not on CRAN, but you can get it from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavisBrian/seqtools")
```

## Examples

The following example uses seqtools to solve a fairly realistic problem: With phenotype, genotype, and a snpinfo file for each "gene", run a T5 test.

[TBD]


## Philosophy

The goal is to provide a robust set of tools to interface with various GWAS testing methods and elimnate (or at least catch early) common mistakes.

### Phenotype

### Genotype

### SnpInfo
